# Movie Browser

A React-Native App. It lets you search for a movie and look at the ratings, cast, director and brief plot of the movie.

## API
I have used the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for this app.
```
The Open Movie Database
The OMDb API is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information, all content and images on the site are contributed and maintained by our users.
